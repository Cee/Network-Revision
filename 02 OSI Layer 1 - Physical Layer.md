#OSI Layer 1: Physical Layer

###Type of Network

+ Shared Media / P2P

###LAN Media

+ STP(Shielded Twisted Pair)

	- Media and connector size: Medium to large
	
	- Speed and throughput: 10 - 100 Mbps
	
	- Expensive
	
+ ScTP(Screened Twisted Pair)

+ UTP(Unshielded Twisted Pair)

	- Media and connector size: Small
	
	- Speed and throughput: 10 - 100 Mbps
	
	- Least Expensive
	
	- Easy to install
	
	- Using an RJ Connector
	
+ Coaxial Cable
	
	- Media and connector size: Medium
	
	- Speed and throughput: 10 - 100 Mbps
	
	- Inexpensive
	
+ Fiber-Optic
	
	- Media and connector size: Small
	
	- Speed and throughput: 100+ Mbps
	
	- Most expensive
	
	- Mode types: Single Mode / Multimode
	
+ Wireless Communication

	- Frequency multiplexing(频率多路传输)
	
###UTP for Ethernet

+ Type of cable
	
	- Straight Cable(直连线)

	- Rollover Cable(全反线): Console cable
	
		+ connect a workstation or terminal to the console port of a router/switch to configure it

	- Crossover Cable(交叉线)
	
		+ connect two or more hubs or switches 
		
		+ connect two isolated workstations to create a mini-LAN
		
###Media and Signal Problems

+ Travel time

+ Loss of singal over distance

+ Reflection

+ Noise

+ Time delay

+ Collision

###Basic Knowledge of Data Communication

+ Signal: analogous / digital

+ Line coding: Manchester

+ Division Multiplexing: TDM(Time), FDM(Freq.), WDM(Wavelength), CDM(Code)

+ Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex Transmission
